# Regork-Sales-EDA
## Introduction
The Regork Marketing Team is making a year-round plan to allocate their budget on promotions. They are curious if there are any times of the year, such as holidays, that experienced the spike in sale, in order to plan accordingly and optimize the Return on Ads (ROAs) for the following year.
The project will explore and analyze the sales in 2017 to uncover the differences in sales among holidays and non-holidays to decide which time of the year worth extra of marketing budget.

## Report

## Summary:
Through the exploration and visualization, we discovered that SALES on holidays and the week of that holidays are higher than other normal weeks. With the insights, the Marketing Team should start planning their budget for campaigns according to the level of profitability of each holiday based on week sales (Christmas > Super Bowl > Labor Day > Thanksgiving)

Besides, the sales are not strongly impacted by the number of marketing campaigns running around that day. The team should not run as many campaigns as possible around the holiday but instead focus on improving the quality of the campaigns for each holidays. The team should remind that quality is better than quantity, regarding the marketing campaigns.
